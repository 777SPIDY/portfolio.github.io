Facts and Figures for Waste Management in India
India produces 62 million tonnes of waste annually, with 70% collected, and only 12 million tonnes treated, while 31 million tonnes end up in landfills.
The generation of municipal solid waste is expected to rise to 165 million tonnes by 2030 due to changing consumption patterns and rapid economic growth.
Challenges Faced in Waste Management
India faces challenges in managing waste. The informal sector plays a significant role in extracting value from waste, but many challenges remain.

Rapid urbanization:
 Urban areas with 377 million people generate about 62 million tons of solid waste every year. However, only 43 million tons are collected, and the rest ends up untreated or in landfills.
E-waste is also a growing concern, with projections showing a substantial increase in e-waste generation.
Lack of adequate garbage collection infrastructure, with only 21 million garbage collectors compared to China’s 700 million.
Sorting recyclable materials is also a problem, as only about 30% of waste is properly sorted, leading valuable materials like aluminum and plastics to end up in landfills instead of being recycled.

<mark><b>Scientific studies and planning:</b></mark><br>
 <p>It means understanding the type of waste, the costs involved, and the best locations for disposal facilities.
India needs to invest in innovative technologies and develop a better recycling infrastructure.
Improve waste collection: India has more frequent services, use machines to collect waste, and coordinates the timing of collection with waste generation.
</p>
<mark><b>Combining informal and formal waste collection sectors:</b></mark>
<p>
 This will help with segregation and collection. Other ways to improve include decentralized waste management, where local communities take care of waste treatment, and promoting recycling by implementing supportive policies and regulations.
Treating organic waste through composting and bio-methanation can reduce the amount going to landfills.
</p>
<mark><b>Converting existing dumps into sanitary landfills:</b></mark> 
<p>
But this requires proper funding and expertise.
Integrating technology like RFID-enabled monitoring and GPS tracking can also help in efficient waste management.
Waste-to-energy methods like bio-methanation can convert organic waste into fuel, which is beneficial.
The concept of common waste treatment facilities is being promoted, involving public-private partnerships. The country needs to ensure proper treatment facilities for biomedical and hazardous waste.
Strictly implementing waste management rules, especially the “Polluter Pays Principle,” is crucial to penalize those who don’t comply.
</p>

<mark><b>Public awareness:</b></mark> 
<p>India needs to educate people through community organizations and self-help groups about separating waste, recycling, and composting to make the process more effective and sustainable.
</p>

<mark><b>Conclusion</b></mark>
<p>
India faces significant challenges in the management of waste due to its large population and the huge amount of trash it generates – approximately 1.3 billion tons every year, a third of the global total. India must improve its recycling industry, as only 5% of recycled material is currently reused. Solving these problems is crucial for a sustainable future and environmental protection.
To move forward, India needs to plan for long-term management of waste and adapt strategies to changing lifestyles. Household and institutional waste must be separated at the source to make recycling more efficient.
The goal is to minimize landfill use, but this requires active community participation. Recycling e-waste on a large scale is vital for solving the e-waste disposal problem. India must take action to solve these challenges, as it’s not just an Indian problem but a global one that affects everyone.

<p>Earth is a lot greener than it was 20 years ago. What sounds like a reason to celebrate should be taken with a grain of salt. Leafy green areas that have been added to the Earth’s surface since 2000 and were catalogued by NASA satellite MODIS appeared because of reforestation as well as agricultural activity.

    Especially in China and India increased human activity has caused more areas to be covered with plants. China increased its green area by 17.8 percent between 2000 and 2017, while India added 11.1 percent. The EU, which the study counts among the eleven “countries” with the largest overall leaf-covered area, came in third. Scientists analyzing the data for a study published in the Nature Sustainability journal found that in the case of China, 42 percent of added greenery was from new forests and 32 percent was from cropland. The country has recently invested billions in reforestation programs. India on the other hand had to chalk up 82 percent of its leaf increase to agriculture. In Brazil for example, the increase in green cropland was still offset almost entirely by the disappearance of forests and savanna vegetation.
    
    Overall, the leaf-covered area on Earth increased by more than 4 percent in the 18 years surveyed, two-thirds of the increase being from agricultural activity. Especially the use of genetically modified crops, multiple growth cycles, intensive irrigation and fertilizer use as well as farm mechanization has made agriculture more visible on satellite imagery, especially in developing nations.
