&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1><b><mark>Survey on the Awareness of Environmental Issues Among the General Public
     (in Japan and 24 other countries)</mark></b></h1>
             <h3><b>Climate change was rated as the top issue<br>
              As of 2023, the average perceived level of SDG achievement across all age groups was 35%. The average for 18-24-year-olds
              was 41%, slightly higher than the older generation.<br>
              Regarding the SDGs that participants thought will have the lowest level of realization, there was a global trend of expressing
              concerns about equality and peace.</b></h3>

   The Asahi Glass Foundation, chaired by Takuya Shimamura, conducted an online survey of 13,500 people in Japan and 24 other countries
   in total, with 6,589 participants aged 18-24, and 6,911 participants aged 25-69. Its goal was to assess awareness and action regarding
   environmental issues. The survey was supervised by Professor Norichika Kanie of Keio University.<br>
<mark>Its main findings were as follows:</mark><br>
<b>    Overall, participants rated "Climate Change" as the most pressing environmental issue in the country or region where they reside and
    expressed concern over extreme weather conditions. This was followed by "Society, Economy and Environment, Policies, Measures,
    and "Water Resources."<br>
    The participants chose Japan as the country that is making progress in terms of public awareness and action on environmental issues,
    followed by the USA and China. The reasons for choosing Japan included "the people are disciplined" and "it has excellent technology."<br>
    As of 2023, the average perceived level of SDG achievement across all age groups was 35.0%. The average for 25-69-year-olds was 33.9%,
    while 18-24-year-olds was 41.1%, slightly higher than the older generation.<br>
    Out of the 17 SDGs, "No Poverty" (1st), "Zero Hunger" (2nd), and "Good Health and Well-being" (3rd) were selected as the goals that
    interested participants most in their daily lives. "Climate Action" did not rank within the top 3.<br>
    The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that participants thought will have the highest level of realization by 2030 were
    "Zero Hunger" (1st), "Good Health and Wellbeing" (2nd), and "No Poverty" (3rd). The SDGs that participants thought would have the
    lowest level of realization were "No Poverty" (1st), "Reduced Inequalities" (2nd), and "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"
    (3rd). The percentage of people who were concerned about equality and peace was higher than last year, possibly due to the
    influence of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.<br>
    When showing the time on the Environmental Doomsday Clock (environmental crisis awareness time), from 0:01 to 12:00, participants of
    all age brackets averaged out at 7:23, meaning "fairly concerned." 18-24-year-olds averaged out slightly lower at 7:03, while 25-69-year-olds
    were at 7:27, meaning they were slightly more concerned. The average time given by global environmental experts was two hours ahead of
    the general public, at 9:31, "extremely concerned." But both experts and the general public expressed a sense of crisis.</b>

※Questions 1, 4, 5 and 6, shown on the following pages, are taken from the "Questionnaire on Environmental Problems and the Survival
of Humankind", a 2023 survey conducted among global environmental experts by the Asahi Glass Foundation. The questions have been
simplified for the general public.<br><br>

※The "Questionnaire on Environmental Problems and the Survival of Humankind" has been carried out annually since 1992. It assesses
awareness of environmental issues among global environmental experts registered in the Asahi Glass Foundation's database, including
those in national or local governments, NGOs NPOs, universities and research institutions, corporations, mass media, and so on, worldwide.
Every year, the experts are asked to show their current sense of crisis regarding the environment and the survival of humankind, using the
hands on the "Environmental Doomsday Clock."<br><br>

The list was drawn from the top 50 countries shown in the "2022 SDG Index & Dashboards," a by-country ranking of the progress made towards
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals set forth by the United Nations.<br><br>
Overall, the countries thought to be making progress in terms of public awareness and action on environmental issues were Japan (1st), the
USA (2nd) and China (3rd). In Indonesia and Turkey, there were many respondents who ranked Japan in first place, citing reasons such as
"people are disciplined" and "there is excellent technology."<br><br>
Out of the 25 countries surveyed, excluding Indonesia, Turkey, Nigeria, Belgium, and Poland, respondents in 20 countries ranked their own
country in first place.<br><br>
A selection of the most common reasons given for each issue are listed below.
Some omissions have been made.<br><br>
＜Japan＞
"Japan is known for its strong discipline and excellent technology." (Indonesia)
"Japanese people keep the environment clean in the places they visit and set an example for others." (Turkey)
"Surprisingly, many foreigners say that Japan has a good waste separation system." (Japan)<br><br>

＜USA＞
"A country that has initiated movements for every issue related to global warming and climate change." (Indonesia)
"The most developed country in the world, possessing all resources and technology to overcome heat." (India)
"There are many companies that are working harder than anywhere else to be more environmentally friendly." (USA)<br><br>

＜China＞
"Promoting clean energy, electric vehicles, and the planting of millions of trees." (Singapore)
"In a very short time, China transformed from one of the most polluted countries on Earth to one of the least polluted." (Spain)
"China Implemented regulations banning all activities that harm the environment and issued relevant laws." (China)<br><br>

As of 2023, the perceived level of SDG achievement varies from country to country, but the average of 25 countries
was 35.0%. Developing countries tend to perceive higher levels of achievement.<br><br>
Among 25 countries, 10.8% of the respondents answered 0% for the perceived level of SDG achievement, indicating
that approximately one-tenth of the respondents believe that there has been no SDG achievement at all.<br><br>
By generation, the average for 18-24-year-olds is 41.1%, while the average for 25-69-year-olds is 33.9%,
indicating that the younger generation perceives a higher level of SDG achievement by 7.2 percentage points.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
